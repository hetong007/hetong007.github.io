I'm currently a Senior Applied Scientist in AWS Shanghai AI Lab. I worked for AWS in Palo Alto from Feb. 2018, and moved to Shanghai since Sep. 2019. I got my Master's degree in Computing Science from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in 2016, under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Ester](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ester/). My research interests are mainly on computer vision and machine learning.

# Trivia

- There are at least two other researchers named "Tong He" [[1](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=kWADCMUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)], [[2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6o-fksAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)], although possibly in different Chinese characters, in the domain of Computer Vision. Please check their profiles if you got confused because some automated systems mistakenly assigned their works to my profile.
